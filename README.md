Convolutional neural network for basic shapes classification using TensorFlow.

Unzip all files to one common folder.

To retrain existing neural network ("net" folder), type in Command Prompt:

> python path_to_"train_model.py"_file

To train new neural network, delete existing "net" folder before execute above command.
